		bio: [
			'I\'m a developer who believes great code should feel invisible. When I\'m not crafting pixel-perfect interfaces, you\'ll find me diving deep into AI and LLMs, because the future of web development isn\'t just about making things look good—it\'s about making them think smart.',
			'My journey started with Vue.js at a tech firm in Lahore, where I learned that the best code is the code that makes users forget they\'re using an app. I\'ve helped boost engagement rates and conversion metrics, but my proudest moments come from those "wow" reactions when users interact with something I built.',
			'Now I\'m on an exciting pivot into Python, AI, and LLM development. Why? Because I want to build applications that don\'t just respond to users—they anticipate needs, learn preferences, and create genuinely intelligent experiences. Think of it as moving from "making things work" to "making things think."',
			'When I\'m not coding, I\'m probably debugging my life choices or exploring new technologies. I believe in ethical AI, responsible development, and the power of collaboration. Because the best solutions come from diverse perspectives and a willingness to learn from every interaction.'
