EMAILJS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHEHARZAD'S PORTFOLIO
===================================================

ðŸŽ¯ PROBLEM SOLVED: Your Next.js is using static export which doesn't support API routes.
EmailJS works perfectly with static sites!

ðŸ“§ SETUP STEPS:

1. CREATE EMAILJS ACCOUNT
   - Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
   - Sign up for free account
   - Verify your email

2. ADD EMAIL SERVICE
   - Go to Email Services â†’ Add New Service
   - Choose "Outlook" or "Gmail" 
   - Connect your sheharzad.salahuddin9000@outlook.com
   - Note the SERVICE ID (e.g., "service_abc123")

3. CREATE EMAIL TEMPLATE
   - Go to Email Templates â†’ Create New Template
   - Template content:
   
   Subject: New Hire Request: {{project_type}}
   
   Body:
   New Hire Request from {{from_name}}
   
   Name: {{from_name}}
   Email: {{from_email}}
   Project Type: {{project_type}}
   Message: {{message}}
   
   This email was sent from your portfolio website.
   
   - Note the TEMPLATE ID (e.g., "template_xyz789")

4. GET PUBLIC KEY
   - Go to Account â†’ General
   - Copy your PUBLIC KEY (e.g., "user_1a2b3c4d5e")

5. UPDATE YOUR CODE
   Replace these placeholders in components/HireMeModal.jsx:
   
   const serviceId = 'your_service_id_here';
   const templateId = 'your_template_id_here';  
   const publicKey = 'your_public_key_here';

6. TEST THE FORM
   - Your hire me form should now work!
   - Emails will be sent to sheharzad.salahuddin9000@outlook.com
   - No server configuration needed

ðŸš€ BENEFITS:
âœ… Works with static export
